# LocalGaboosh
Project is a fork of DougDoug's Babagaboosh 
So credit to DougDoug for the original!

The idea behind this project is to have the same functions as normal Babagaboosh but without needed to pay for any of the Ai services online by using local Open Source alternatives.

For the original version go to DougDoug's Github here: <https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh>

## Using the App

1) Run `chatgpt_character.py'

2) Once it's running, press F4 to start the conversation, and Azure Speech-to-text will listen to your microphone and transcribe it into text.

3) Once you're done talking, press P. Then the code will send all of the recorded text to the Ai. Note that you should wait a second or two after you're done talking before pressing P so that Azure has enough time to process all of the audio.

4) Wait a few seconds for OpenAi to generate a response and for Elevenlabs to turn that response into audio. Once it's done playing the response, you can press F4 to start the loop again and continue the conversation.
